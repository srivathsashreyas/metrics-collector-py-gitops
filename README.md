# Overview

This is the gitops repo for the metrics-collector-py project (https://github.com/srivathsashreyas/metrics-collector-py). It contains packages the relevant components in the project as a helm chart. You can use this for a local deployment as well. But if you're planning to experiment, consider using the Dockerfile and manifests provided in the main repo to build and deploy the components. 

Note: The image tags provided in the values.yaml file will be updated 
based on changes in the main repo.
